  abstract	= "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common
		  neurodegenerative disorders. Several toxin-induced animals
		  models simulate the motor deficits occurring in PD. Among
		  them, the unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) model is
		  frequently used in rats and has the advantage of presenting
		  side-biased motor impairments. However, the behavioral
		  consequences of a unilateral 6-OHDA-lesion have, so far,
		  not been described in detail in mice. The aim of this study
		  was to characterize mice with unilateral 6-OHDA-lesions
		  placed in the median forebrain bundle using several motor
		  behavioral tests in order to identify the most suitable
		  predictor of nigral cell loss. Mice underwent various
		  drug-induced (amphetamine- and apomorphine-induced
		  rotation) and spontaneous motor tests (cylinder, rotarod,
		  elevated body swing, and stride length test). The
		  amphetamine-induced rotation test, the cylinder and the
		  rotarod test were most sensitive and reliable in detecting
		  loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive cells in the
		  substantia nigra. This study demonstrates that substantial
		  and stable unilateral 6-OHDA-induced lesions can be
		  established in mice, and that these lesions can be
		  functionally assessed using several different
		  side-bias-based behavioral tests. This mouse model offers
		  the opportunity to use transgenic mouse strains and study
		  the interactions between genes of interest and toxins in
		  relation to Parkinson's disease etiology in the future.",

		  computer-generated visual environment to perform spatial
		  behaviours. Robust place-cell activity was present during
		  movement along a virtual linear track. From whole-cell
		  recordings, we identified three subthreshold signatures of
		  place fields: an asymmetric ramp-like depolarization of the
		  baseline membrane potential, an increase in the amplitude
		  of intracellular theta oscillations, and a phase precession
		  of the intracellular theta oscillation relative to the
		  extracellularly recorded theta rhythm. These intracellular
		  dynamics underlie the primary features of place-cell rate
		  and temporal codes. The virtual-reality system developed
		  here will enable new experimental approaches to study the

  abstract	= "In vivo oxygen measurement is the key to understanding how
		  biological systems dynamically adapt to reductions in
		  oxygen supply. High spatial resolution oxygen imaging is of
		  particular importance because recent studies address the
		  significance of within-tissue and within-cell
		  heterogeneities in oxygen concentration in health and
		  disease. Here, we report a new technique for in vivo
		  molecular imaging of oxygen in organs using green
		  fluorescent protein (GFP). GFP-expressing COS-7 cells were
		  briefly photoactivated with a strong blue light while
		  lowering the oxygen concentration from 10\% to
		  {\textless}0.001\%. Red fluorescence (excitation 520â550
		  nm, emission {\textgreater}580 nm) appeared after
		  photoactivation at {\textless}2\% oxygen (the red shift of
		  GFP fluorescence). The red shift disappeared after
		  reoxygenation of the cell, indicating that the red shift is
		  stable as long as the cell is hypoxic. The red shift of GFP
		  fluorescence was also demonstrated in single cardiomyocytes
		  isolated from the GFP knock-in mouse (green mouse) heart.
		  Then, we tried in vivo molecular imaging of hypoxia in
		  organs. The red shift could be imaged in the ischemic liver
		  and kidney in the green mouse using macroscopic optics
		  provided that oxygen diffusion from the atmospheric air was
		  prevented. In crystalloid-perfused beating heart isolated
		  from the green mouse, significant spatial heterogeneities
		  in the red shift were demonstrated in the epicardium distal
		  to the coronary artery ligation. We conclude that the
		  present technique using GFP as an oxygen indicator may
		  allow in vivo molecular imaging of oxygen in organs.",
